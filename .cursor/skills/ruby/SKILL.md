# Ruby Skills

This directory holds **Ruby-specific** skills. All examples and references use Ruby (and RSpec where tests are shown).

## Available skills

- **solid** — SOLID principles, TDD, clean code, design patterns, architecture. Path: `ruby/solid/`
- **rspec** — RSpec and Rails testing best practices from [Better Specs](https://www.betterspecs.org/). Path: `ruby/rspec/`

Use **solid** when writing or refactoring Ruby; use **rspec** when writing or reviewing RSpec specs, request specs, or integration tests.
